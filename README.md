This project uses the following materials:
* Adafruit FLORA
* Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466
* 144-pixel NeoPixel LED strip
* 3.7V LiPo battery

In this project, the analog microphone sensor gathers noise level information from the environment, filters the data, and outputs LED lights on the NeoPixel strip corresponding to the current noise level.
